    "prompt": "Summarize the following text in a few sentences: \n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, transforming various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. This has led to the development of autonomous systems, like self-driving cars and advanced diagnostic tools. However, with the rise of AI, there are concerns about job displacement, privacy issues, and the ethical implications of decision-making by machines. Researchers and policymakers are working together to create frameworks that ensure AI benefits society while minimizing potential harms. \n\nSummary: ",
